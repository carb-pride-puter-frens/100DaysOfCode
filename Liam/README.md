# 100 Days of Code - Liam
I plan to learn some new programming languages in no particular order, and probably erratically out of order. I wouldn't be surprised if I end up working on something in C#, switch to another after a few days and come back to it in a week. I will likely add to the lists below throughout the 100 days if I find something else interesting I would like to mess around with.

Any project files I make will be stored in this repo as well for everyone else to view, experiment, and/or build off of if they want. Learning for all :^)

## Stuff I would like to learn/experiment with
- C# (also .NET?)
- Assembly
- C
- Go
- React
- Kotlin (Android apps preferred lang)
- C++
- Unity
- NoSQL
- Python

## Stuff I have used but would like to learn more about
- Web dev
  - PHP
  - Javascript
- Arduino
  
## Possible projects
- Egg simulator game
  - complex soft-body physics and rigid-body shatter algorithms to work on/with
- Z80 Microcomputer
- 68k Microcomputer
