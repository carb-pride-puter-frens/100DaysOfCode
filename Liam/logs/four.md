## Day 4 (1/8/2020)

20 minutes spent

Did some initial research into Assembly and assemblers. 

Things to note in Assembly and machine code:
- Endianness is very important
    - little endian processors read bytes from lowest to highest: 0xABCD is read 0xCD first, then 0xAB
    - big endian is the reverse: 0xABCD -> 0xAB, then 0xCD
