## Day 2 (1/5/2020)

8 hours spent

More work on arduino code for flashing a W29C020C flash IC.
Also worked on some python scripts to interface with my arduino code.
Bailey also showed me how to integrate git with vscode and do some branching for best practice.

Things to note in Arduino:
- arrays passed through function parameters are just pointers, and are handled differently in the case of methods like sizeof()
