# 100 Days of Code - Michael Bailey
My main focus for these 100 days is gonna be pretty flexible. I don't have any specific agenda planned, but I want to tackle this main stuff
- Frontend Development
    - HTML/CSS
        - I already have the basics down, but I feel like I could do a lot better when it comes to the more intermediate or advanced stuff
        - My source for this is gonna be FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Frontend Certification
        - At first, the HTML stuff will be a breeze. It estimates 300 hours for it all but I think I can finish it quicker than that
        - I'm only gonna do one or two of the main end projects, I'll take up more at the end if I have time
    - JS DOM/jQuery
        - Same as above, I know JS, but would like a refresher for the DOM parts
        - Don't think I'll take long on it either
        - One project using jQuery
    - Sass
        - This might take a bit longer and is something that has seem quite interesting
        - One project using SASS (maybe combine with jQuery project)
    - Bootstrap
        - Just a glance through, I won't do any projects about it. May even skip it
    - ***React + Redux***
        - This is the major one out of these that I want to become better with
        - Tried to go through it but lost the knowledge over time
- Backend Development
    - NodeJS webdev has been my go to for years, so on this one, I would like to focus on different stacks I haven't used
        - Spring Boot (Java)
        - Deeper dive into ASP.NET Core (C#/.NET)
        - Ruby on Rails
        - Django
    - Main point is to be able to pick up any major backend system at any point. If I decide to leave my job for a Java shop, I won't get lost
    - Databases
        - Already pretty good grasp on working with MongoDB, Postgres, MySQL, etc., so just a refresher at some point maybe
- DevOps
    - Learn CI/CD basics using Azure Pipelines, TravisCI, etc.
    - Learn about deployments
    - Possibly work towards certs in either AWS or Azure
    - Docker and Kubernetes
- Game Development
    - Learn the basics of how Unity works
    - Tbh I might separate this out into 100 Days of Game Development at some point down the road, not during this 100 days

## Relative order of things I want to tackle
- HTML/CSS
- JS DOM/jQuery
- Sass/Bootstrap
- React
- Redux
- ASP.NET Core Web APIs
- Azure Pipelines
- Deployments on Cloud Services
- Docker and Kubernetes
- Spring Boot
- Django
- Ruby + Rails
- Advanced stuff on deployments
- Game development

This list is subject to change order, have stuff added, or removed at any point. It's also not guaranteed that I will hit all of these in 100 days, but moving forward I can start to pick up parts I missed over time.

## Project Ideas
Here's some ideas for projects I have, this also will expand and decrease over time most likely:
- Gunfight Stats website where friends and I keep stats on how we're doing relatively in our 2v2 Gunfight matches in MW
- Discord bot that can collect any messages through webhooks and display them on specific channels
    - i.e. server status, pull requests, etc.
- Simple todo list
- Portfolio website
- Private journal site where I can write messages in blog/markdown format to myself. Only I would have access to it
- Create my own identity server where I can service auth for any project I choose

## Suggestions?
Feel free to open an issue and tag me in it for suggestions, comments, or questions :)
