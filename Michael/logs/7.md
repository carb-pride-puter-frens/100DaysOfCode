# Day 7 - 01/08/20

Time Spent: 30 minutes

## Planning

- Decided to make a version of a portfolio site as my first project using CSS
- Parts I want to include
    - Photo of myself as well as a short header
    - Experience
    - Education
    - Favorite GitHub projects
- Need to draw it out but I have some sort of idea I think at first
- Cool templates I like
    - https://www.loungelizard.com/
    - http://seanhalpin.io/
    - https://bepatrickdavid.com/
- Basic idea
    - Main header which is fullscreen and is quick to see
    - Small interweaved sections below it

## Personal Notes (if any)

- Didn't spend much time today for this as I have to be up by 5:30AM tomorrow morning
- Figured the best thing for today is to plan
