# Day 1 - 1/2/2020

Time spent - ~2 hours

## GitHub

- Made the repo, org, and team for facilitating this between friends and I

## My Repo

- Updated the README so that I can have a path to follow

## Development

### Frontend

- Started HTML/CSS portion of FreeCodeCamp. Did the following lessons:
    - Entire Basic HTML and HTML5 section

## Personal Notes

- I probably could have skipped the Basic HTML portion lol. It offered no value at all to me, most of the stuff in there is stuff I already knew.
- Glad to get all the setup for the repo done
- Main focus for tomorrow is gonna be Basic CSS. I got stuff about colors, fonts and the like down, as well as super basic positioning, but transitions and different values + when to use them is what trips me up some in CSS.
- I'm not aiming to be a CSS master after this, just slightly more confident, hopefully to a point where I don't have to rely on Bootstrap every time
