# Day 2 - 1/3/2020

Time Spent: 1 hour

## GitHub

- Added template file to make logging easier
- Added a notes folder under logs to throw notes into

# FreeCodeCamp - CSS

- Did the following lessons:
    - Start: Change the color of text
    - End: Override All Other Stypes by using Important

# Notes Taken Today - CSS

- Adding notes I saved tomorrow

## Personal Notes (if any)

- I definitely recognized a lot of the stuff so far in the Basic CSS portion
- I took way too many notes about it, but maybe that would be for the best
    - If I write it down, I'll remember it better for sure
- Tomorrow is a Saturday, so I'll probably be spending a lot of time on this, so I wouldn't be surprised if at the minimum I finish Basic CSS, maybe even Applied Visual Design
    - There's a TON about intermediate and advanced CSS in the next session and using it to make certain popular design features. That's where I'll get a lot of the value from for sure
