# Day 6 - 01/07/20

Time Spent: 1.5 hours

## FreeCodeCamp

- Finished Applied Visual Design

## Notes - Applied Visual Design

- `transform` is a property that transforms an element depending on certain functions which are available
    - `scale(n)` scales an element to it's current size times `n` (< 0 - 0.99, 1.01 < x) (pretty much not negative, 0, or 1 unless needed)
        - The semantics of this are pretty similar to `em` it seems, except, probably, in a different way
    - `skewX(ndeg)` skews an element `n` degrees (-359 - 359) on the X axis (yes, in 3D, so the ends skew towards the 3D X axis)
    - `skewY(ndeg)` is the same as `skewX()`, but on the Y axis
    - `rotate(ndeg)` rotates an element so many degrees
- `@keyframes` is a rule that allows for CSS to follow instructions on creating animations
    - It forms as a block of blocks which run given a certain percentage it's through an animation
        - ex: different values at the start (0%), middle (50%), or end (100%)
    - It has a name, and it's selected by an element via said name
- `animation` determines which `@keyframes` rule runs on the element it's in
    - `animation-name` is the name of the `@keyframes` block you wanna refer to
    - `animation-duration` is the amount of time you want the animation to run from 0% to 100%
    - `animation-fill-mode` determines which style to carry once the animation is done
        - `forwards` takes whatever is in 100%
    - `animation-iteration-count` says how many times to run the animation (a number or `infinite`)
    - `animation-timing-function` controls how quickly an animated event changes over the duration of it
        - Default value is `ease`, which starts slow, then speeds up, then slows down towards the end
        - `ease-in` starts slow then speeds up
        - `ease-out` starts out then slows down
        - `linear` keeps it at the same speed throughout
- `cubic-bezier()` helps give finer control to animations by giving anchor points which live on a Bezier curve
    - Lives on a 1 x 1 coordinate system
        - X axis determines the duration and the Y axis is the change in animation
    - 4 args, p0, p1, p2, and p3
        - p0 and p3 is the duration of the changes in p1 and p2
            - p0 and p3 are set automatically and do not need to be changed unless there is some emergency dire need
        - The p1 and p2 anchor points are determined by a X and Y value
    - Actual function arguments: (p1x, p1y, p2x, p2y)
    - So, the usage of this allows you to change time `animation-timing-function` by determining a custom function essentially, so you could speed up or slow down at a different point

## Personal Notes (if any)

- Glad I got that done, finally will be on to my first project tomorrow
- Bezier curves were wild, I won't lie. I'll need to read through that one a few more times lol
- I also listened to the entirety of GINGER by BROCKHAMPTON, its definitely maybe in their top 2 or 3 albums so far
