# Day 5 - 1/6/2020

Time Spent: 2 hours

## GitHub

- Renamed logs so that they will show up in order
- Updated README to include new Trello board

## Trello

- Created a Trello board that can be used to keep track on what I'm working on or researching
- Will update board with all I have planned over time
- Will eventually delete the roadmap on the README in lieu of the Trello board

## Scripts

- Created a Python script to help me create logs based on the template. I copied a lot of it from bits and pieces I found on SO lmao

## Personal Notes (if any)

- So I didn't really work on any CSS today, which wasn't my original plan, but I was glad I decided to go down the rabbit hole of finding more efficient ways to deal with these 100 days
    - The Trello board will give me a much better insight of what I want to plan to make over the course of it
    - The Python script makes it a lot easier to create new logs
- It was sort-of a breath of fresh air out of the world of color theory and artistic mathematics
    - Plus idk how long it's been since I've had an excuse to make a Python script for something, so that was nice too
- I might add Python in general to my list, it felt weird to use for me, which it shouldn't, it was the first language I learned
