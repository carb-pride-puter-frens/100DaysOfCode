# #100DaysOfCode

## Purpose

100 Days of Code is a challenge to write and research programming topics and fields you might be interested in learning more about over the course of about 100 days. The main purpose of it, overall, is to get yourself into the habit of working on personal projects or (if you work outside of the software development space) just coding for at least an hour a day. You can find a good article about the guy who brought the idea to the public [here](https://www.100daysofcode.com/). This can also be expanded to different concepts as well, like exercise, music production, cooking, and more. More info about those is given on the site as well.

## What is this repo?

This repo specifically hosts the progress logs, files, and projects of the Carb Pride Puter Frens during this challenge. In the overall scope of things, each person might do something similar or possibly different depending on what they want to learn. You can find info for each person in their README in their personal space.

## Rules

At the minimum, here are the rules we're giving ourselves:

- Spend at least an hour each day either researching topics of interest or (preferribly, if possible) writing code
- Try your best to do it every day for 100 days. Some days might be too busy or other things like work and school may come up, which is fine, but try your best to recoup your time when possible. The biggest point of this is to build a habit, not just get a bunch done, so be vigilant in at least finding an hour per day. *Don't skip more than two days in a row if possible*
- Keep track of your progress and what you're learning. At the minimum, keep track of what you did that day in a log, much like a journal. Feel free to talk about struggles, ask questions, or even write a whole essay if you want to though. If possible, commit code into your space. Here's the way MB is doing it: 
    - In the logs folder, make a Markdown file with information on what you did that day. 
    - In code_snips, put in snippits of code which don't consitute putting it in an entire project. It might be an answer to a ProjectEuler problem, a small portion of some HTML/CSS/JS that you found interesting, a basic runthrough of a language you don't know, etc. 
    - In projects, put in full projects your working on. If possible, put READMEs inside of individual projects to explain what they are. 
    - Try to trace back any extra files or projects you add into your log.
    - ***Feel free to organize in any way that's helpful to you***

## Day One [Example Log]

### FreeCodeCamp

- Started on Front-End/Responsive Web Design lessons. I know HTML/CSS/JS, but am not an expert of it, so I would like to refresh on some more of the advance topics, especially for CSS.
- Did the following lessons: (list all you did below)
- Tested out a small thing I found, made a mini-website featuring it, you can find it here: (point to folder/wherever)

### GitHub

- Made a repo for the challenge
- Found some good resources on learning Git

### Projects

- Started a project for making a React SPA, you can find it here: (point to folder with the project)

### Research

- Read some about C, found some good resources to start copying from to learn more

## I'm interested in contributing or trying this out

Unfortunately, we're most likely not opening up this specific repo for forking unless you ask beforehand or we approve the PR that comes in, but totally feel free to take the format for yourself or your group of friends. Feel free also to open an issue if you have questions, comments, concerns, or would like to suggest something to one of us, like a project idea or resource.

## Git Practices for this repo (Members Only)

- Pull latest changes from origin/master
- Branch locally from master, starting with either your name or initials followed by what you're doing (i.e. mb-adding-log-five, liam-c-project-using-malloc, ad-hosting-code-to-cloud-deploy, etc.)
- If someone has made changes after you made your local branch, pull in the changes to your local master branch then rebase onto master. This will help avoid merge conflicts. Do be careful though as a misstep can mean losing files or commits forever. Consider making backups somewhere before doing this.
- Push branch to origin. Don't merge into master locally.
- Open a pull request with your change
    - For the most part, if it's just in your space, you can just merge, but do be courteous. If you made changes to another person's space, make sure they approve it before you merge
- Once all criteria is met, merge and delete your branch from GitHub
- Pull in changes from master
- Delete your local branch
